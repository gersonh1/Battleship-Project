# Battleship-Project
Battleship game made in Python by Gerson Hernandez and Yafet Kassa 
This program will simulate a battleship game where each player has 5 ships or aka lives.
Unlike regular battleship, in this game the ships are one size meaning one shot one kill.
First to guess where the other person's ship are located and sinks them all wins! Pretty straight forward no?
The ships are randomly assigned for both players and a hit/miss messages displays after every guess.
This ensures integrity in the game meaning no bluffing of any sort.
The code was updated to keep the terminal clean and only showing what the player has to see, which is their guessing board.
Hope you enjoy! Thanks!
